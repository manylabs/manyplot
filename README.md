# manyplot

This is a Javascript plotting library that can display time series data with 100k+ points.

Additional features:

*   display multipe syncronized time series plots (in separate frames or within the same frame)
*   options for auto-scale and fixed y-axis bounds
*   two timestamp modes: second elapsed and clock times
*   zoom and pan
*   hover to see values
*   display of histograms
*   display of scatter plots

## Note

This library is an agglomeration of code from old projects (with multiple authors); 
we plan to clean it up and re-factor it.
